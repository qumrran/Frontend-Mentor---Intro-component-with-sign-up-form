Here is my solution to the Frontend Mentor task. It was a very interesting experience working with DOM manipulation, form handling, and RegEx. I tried to validate all the fields in the project. The only thing I'm not happy with is the appearance of messages before entering any inputs. There should only be placeholders, and the messages should appear in red after clicking. Nevertheless, I'm pleased with the JavaScript exercise.
